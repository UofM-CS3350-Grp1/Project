Status: Completed
Duration: 5 1/2 Hours

			 - Testing has been limited to successful use cases, there may be bugs.
			 - This WILL BREAK YOUR EXISTING CODE when it is pushed if you use TrackedFeature or Services.
			 
			 WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:
			 	- PULL A CURRENT VERSION AND SAVE AS A BACKUP TODAY before pulling TOMORROW.
			 	- Update your constructors to include a TrackedFeatureType for TrackedFeatures,
			 	and TrackedServiceType for Services. These can be retrieved by the getByID()/tableDump() methods.
				- Use the upcoming getServiceByType() and getFeatureByTitle() to retrieve newly created FeatureTypes/ServiceTypes
			 	- Please refrain from making any changes to domain objects between today and tomorrow night at 5pm.
			 	
			 WHEN WILL THIS TAKE EFFECT:
			 	- I will push the new domain objects at 5pm tomorrow evening.

Discussed current state of development. Decided to focus on client and service management, and leave contract management for later if we have time for it this iteration.
Contract file types were also discussed. Input from within and outside the program were considered. Discussed .txt, .pdf, .docx, and image formats for input and output of
	the base contract, contract stubs, and the signed copy of the contracts. More information about what the client would like is needed before we can proceed with the contracts
