Meeting Summary
Date: 05/30
Discussed current state of development. Decided to focus on client and service management, and leave contract management for later if we have time for it this iteration.
Contract file types were also discussed. Input from within and outside the program were considered. Discussed .txt, .pdf, .docx, and image formats for input and output of
	the base contract, contract stubs, and the signed copy of the contracts. More information about what the client would like is needed before we can proceed with the contracts
