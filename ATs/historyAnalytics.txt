Manual test to add a new Contract.

1. Open the program.
2. Login using a correct user name and password
3. Click the Menu button
4. Select View Clients from the drop down menu
5. Select the Client "Business Small" from the table
6. Click the "View Client" button
7. Examine the various graphs that are created to analyze performance over time (this is a visual test)

note: These graphs are generated over time as the user adds various surveys and expenses to the clients. 
		They cannot be reproduced during acceptance testing as they need time to be populated with date. 
		This is why a client with information already entered into the database was used.
